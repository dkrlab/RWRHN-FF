# RWRHN-FF

RWRHN-FF is a semi-supervised algorithm. It integrates various types of data into a heterogeneous network via type-two fuzzy and implements a random walk with restart on heterogeneous network algorithm to find new nodes. In this method, first, four gene-gene similarity networks are constructed based on different genomic sources and then integrated using the type-II fuzzy voter scheme. The resulting gene-gene network is then linked to a disease-disease similarity network, which itself is constructed by the integration of four sources, through a two-part disease-gene network. The product of this process is a reliable heterogeneous network, which is analyzed by the RWRHN algorithm.
